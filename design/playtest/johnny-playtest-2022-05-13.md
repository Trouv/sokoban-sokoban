## 1 getting used to
- he's getting used to things again
- used the right wall to continually get offset

## 2 set the table

## 3 exorcism?!?
- The fact that the S doesn't do anything is a p big hint
- **I think the exorcism tile on the table is only effective at showing stones are unaffected by them IF the solution requires putting the S there. I doubt it does**
- eventually johnny does this

## 4 bishop
- "Oh I need to get to the bush that's so lame"

## 5 full control
- "Ok you've designed this to make my life hard"
- "If I just change one of these to go down and to the right, which one would that be?"
- Moved S to the right, got excited, realized it doesn't work
- "There were levels the first time I played this where I just had to trial and error"
- Found another unintended solution, but hopefully the new redesign addresses this too

## 6 yoink
- "it's nice that the level has a set beginning"
- This level highly incentivizes redundancy before removal
- This level is good, but maybe early? Maybe it's fine with an improved full control
- "It has to leave the array in order for it to be in position to push it through, that's what makes this level hard"
- He thinks he needs to get something in position, then change the table, but this isn't necessary
- This level seems to almost guaruntee that you need all 4 directions.. almost
- "I can lose down right now", this is an interesting sentiment that lyra shared, direction removal seems like a viable strategy at this point but it's not

skipped

## 7 shift change skip pls

## 8 origami
- "So I can't reach S" correct
- I think the placement of S is effective here at making players realize the diagonal trap
- First tries to move W and A, maybe because he wants to put something on left left?
- "Oh that might help" moves D off the table
- I wonder if the layout of the level is too much of a red herring. Could probably just reduce the height.
- "I like this level. It feels very pure sokoban-sokoban style challenge."
- "This is good because you literally can't do anything"
- "It doesn't let you push anything left very easily, and when it does it fucks you over"
- **I wonder if we could adjust the left fence to be 4x whatever instead of 3x whatever**
- "This is a stumper"
- "It's like I can't even figure out what my goal is" yeah, hope a new intro will help with this.
- Starting to think about symmetry?
- Still hasn't tried moving D left
- Still thinking about how to move A to left left, but has decided it won't work.
- It seems the placement of A and W might be an unintentional red herring. The W seems like an "obstacle" to accessing A, so Johnny's focusing too much on moving A.
- Of course, it's intentional that W is an obstacle to moving A, but it isn't because moving A is a subgoal of the puzzle or anything, quite the opposite.
- Seems like he's finally trying to position himself to move D left?
- "I was thinking maybe I could go somewhere else, like phasing out of position in the corner" hmm maybe not
- whoa unintentional solution?, moving W down and then W+A left
- oh actually, it prevents down so it may be ok
- "those are my two options, but both of them delete a different direction"
- Finally moves the D left, but while working on this W down dead end
- Actually this may be doable, moving A and W left one, then using left left to move D into right up.
- This results in a top left trap, which is maybe is fine?
- God I need a solver for this shit
- Honestly this probably fine. The point of this level is to convert one diagonal trap into another to move the S onto the table, and then to remove all diagonal traps to go for the goal. This is preserved.
- "Seems like all I need are D and S". Movement brain
- Lets see if he figures out that he's in a second diagonal trap
- Figures out you can hold undo, excited about it
