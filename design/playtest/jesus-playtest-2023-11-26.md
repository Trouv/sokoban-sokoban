## Some poor soul lost their gravestone
- Notices QE don't do anything but they have slots for them
- Takes some time on this first level
- Notices the volatile gravestone feature
- Dang this seems to be a lot harder than I expected
- *maybe the salt block is a red herring?*
- He thought there might be a connection between the colors of the stones and their deletion
- it took some time but  I can see the gears turning in the right direction now

## Waxing crescent
- Pushes E to the wall reasonably quickly
- After pushing Q onto the fence for the first time, he quickly undos it saying "that doesn't work"
- Wonders if he needs to try and get E on there instead of Q, restarts
- I guess this puzzle is a little harder than I anticipated too
- *maybe the abundance of corners to take E to teaches the wrong lesson here, that a particular corner matters (it doesnt)

## Trocar
- *This level might be a little too big. it seems like it's hard to tell you can go all the way to the wall to adjust your offset*
- *Could there be a puzzle like this that takes advantage of the player pushing the blocks against a standalone bush?*
- *These visuals desparately need to be gridded. With these new intro puzzles especially*
- *So, actually I think this level can be in a point-of-no-return state. with a gravestone still on the board. I didn't realize this was the case.*

## Vertically challenged
- I think there's a reluctance to restart the level that makes these no-return states so much worse.
- *Perhaps this level would be better with the two stones stacked from the get go?*
- *I guess the all-straight movement tables are especially prone to points of no return*

**Skipped**

## Felt presence
- I think this puzzle is a little better because it doesn't have such un-obvious points of no return
- He's able to reason about this one a lot better.
