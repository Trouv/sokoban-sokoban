Lyra has some experience with this game so this playtest won't be representative of beginners.

# Some poor soul lost their gravestone
- She is able to find the method to offset by 1 pretty quickly
- She gets stuck in the trap
- When she tries moving the stone down for the first time, she said "well that's not gonna work".
(It will)
- "I really wanna play with arrow keys".
Controls do need to be rebindable some day.
- I'm happy to see her struggling with this puzzle a little bit despite her experience level.
- "I like the variety of the dead shrubbery"
- "It really feels like it wants me to go [up], but obviously there's all this space [to the right]"

She finishes it.
- "It doesn't feel like a level 1 to me".
I'll choose to take this as a compliment.

# Premature burial
This level has received the heaviest redesign in the past week.
Interested to see if it's something she can reason about, and if removing redundant solutions helps her learn the right lesson.
- Pushes Q down first
- "I can use that to change my grid"
- Figures out she can push Q into the wall to access E
- She got pretty close but having to push Q away at the end repelled her.
- *This is either distracting from the concept of the level, or it's a good additional lesson, not sure.*
- I think I just noticed an untentional solution, where you put E to the bottom right of the bushes.
- *Confirmed, this puzzle has an unintentional solution.*
- Actually, this unintentional solution might be better.. hmm

She solved it via the unintentional solution.
- "I really want some visual feedback about what grid I'm interacting with"
- "It's easy to accidentally get on the wrong grid"
*I think having a very different sound effect for when you offset might be good.*
Though, I guess this would just be a "bumping into a wall" sound effect.

# Trocar
She hasn't played this since the introduction of volatility, curious to see if this level surprises her.
- She works out some theorems about interacting with these stones on this all-straight grid.
In particular, she notices that, because the first stone was on the same "grid" as her, her first move on it pushes it by one which locks it either vertically or horizontally.
- She accepts pushing Q into the bush as the definitive first move.
- She pushes E into the bush from the bottom.
*This seems like a pretty attractive strategy for players, it's like they want the plant to become more useful.*
- Realizes there are two "medium-colored grids"
*I think alternating color in one dimension would be a little more helpful.*
- "I feel like when I accomplish things in this game so far that I actually figured it out, like I can reproduce it."
This is a good sign that the redesigns are effective so far.
- She figures it out and then tries to reproduce it.
- The salt volatility successfully surprised her.

# Vertically challenged
- It's taking her some time here to actually push the stones into eachother, but she eventually does.
- "I'd love to be able to draw on the screen"

This one maybe seems a little underdeveloped.

# Felt presence
- She notices D is in a different position via the table rather than the display.
- She eventually notices the display is different too.
- She thinks that it's impossible to get put yourself directly below the first salt tile at first.
- She seems to be remembering the value of interrupts.
- After destroying the 2nd highest salt in the wall, she realizes she has to destroy the bottom one instead.
- She's able to figure out the post-salt-wall part of the puzzle pretty easily.

She really likes this one because it's a bit easier to reason about puzzles when the movements aren't all straight.
*I still kind of don't like how unrelated the final part of the puzzle is to the meat of it.*

# Jaw
- She is able to navigate the train obstacle pretty quickly.
- She is really appreciative of the new control display design.
- "This one is interesting because it's very limiting"
- *I agree, I think it's appropriate to place at this point in the game because there aren't actually a lot of decisions for the player to make.*
- She tries pushing S towards W first and realizes that it's a very linear operation, she can't do anything else meaningful but keep pushing.
- After rewinding to before she pushes S, she realizes that pushing W towards S would have a similar result.
(She tries this anyway)
- After this she tries pushing S up one before grabbing W, then works W to its destination.
- The puzzle was still solvable at this point, but she thought S was in an impossible position
- Now she figures out she needs to push S all the way up.

This level pretty much always goes exactly as it is designed to.
I'm still happy with it.

# Marguerite
- "I think we kill the left and right salt to push through to the left"
- She rethinks this for a moment and realizes that it won't work, she needs to use Q to make a path for E.
- "So many options, this one is crazy"
- She tries to reach E, skipping W, but realizes she can't.
- She actually tries killing the top salt first, surprisingly, though she stops this route after reaching E, not sure how to get it past the salt.
- She then tries to solve by killing the right one, but then she realizes, that even making a path for Q doesn't work.
- She has the final part of the solution solved - she needs a stone in the top salt's position.

# Barrier magic
- She laments that she can't draw on the screen.
- She's recognizing how many "deadzones" this puzzle has, and recognizes that it's because her vertical moves are left-first.
- She has recognized the fundamental problem here: how do you push a stone into position for the right ghost without making another stone inaccessible?
- "I feel like I'm at the cusp of the solution but it seems imposible"
- *I do wonder if this puzzle is a little bit inaccessible.
However, I can't really think of a way to introduce the idea of canceling movement off a stone earlier.
Doing it like this might be the best way.*
- *I wonder if it would be possible to make the player accidentally do this kind of move early on in the puzzle.*
- She does figure it out eventually.
- "That one kind of pissed me off actually."

So I think this level might need to be re-examined.
Like, is it really necessary to make the left goal so committal?
Is it really necessary to make the top right corner so trecherous?

# D row
- "This seems like an actual first level"
- Solves it very quickly.

*This one is still a bit of a throwaway, would like to try redesigning it.*

# Danse de la terre
- She likes this one on first sight because the goal ghosts are on the table
- She manages to get into the left part of the puzzle but realizes she can't get back
- She's able to think through the obstacle.. "I need to have a right-up, up-right."
- She seems to be having a lot of trouble changing color here, even though that's not really the main challenge this puzzle presents.
- Yeah this keeps coming up, I don't really know why.
- *We might need to revive or redesign "The bishop changes colors", the color lesson seems to have not solidified yet.*
- "Whatever movements let me get back and forth through here will solve the whole puzzle"
- She figures out she needs right-up, up-right for this, but she keeps coming back to "will that be able to put me into position?"
- "Every puzzle so far has a key, and as long as I can figure out the key I can figure out the puzzle"

Her thoughts here about figuring out the key to a puzzle and not having to worry about everything else are interesting.
I think this relates to just thinking about the game more and more abstractly.

# Minotaur
I'm not expecting her to continue at this point, I let her know that this one might be a little too hard right now.

- She's able to figure out a lot here before making any moves.
- *The grass is a huge red herring...*
- I went ahead and clued her in that she need not worry about the grass.

We decided to stop here.

# Follow up questions

What were your favorite/least favorite levels?
- Favorites were "Felt presence" and "Danse de la terre"
- Least favorite was "Barrier magic"

*I think she liked "Felt presence" because it's the first level that has a not-all-straight movement table, which is a bit of relief from the oppressive tables in the previous levels.
This makes me wonder if the beginning of the game focusing on all-straight tables for so long is bad.
I think we could maybe get away with removing "Vertically challenged", as its lesson isn't really that important for a while.*

*I'm assuming she didn't like "Barrier magic" because it just doesn't seem possible, the solution is a bit too far out of the box.
I think this puzzle is a bit sloppy and could likely be improved given some more thought.
In particular, I'd like to try to demonstrate the key mechanic used to solve the puzzle earlier in the puzzle, making the player accidentally perform it.*
