# Some poor soul lost their gravestone
- Has some trouble figuring out he needs to use keyboard
- Apparently the game maps to dvorak well?
- He assumed the ghost guy was gonna kill him (maybe titles in-game would help with this?)
- He figured this one out pretty quickly

# Narrow ritual
- He's having a little more trouble with this one
- Discovers that gravestones and salt destroy eachother
- Interprets the salt as clouds
- He has a lot of ideas for what might work here that are being thwarted, but is allergic to pushing things against the wall so he can't find the actual solution
- So like... I still think this level isn't the best introduction to salt.
- The salt isn't that much more effective than bushes would be. If anything, if you realize you can delete them, it's a red herring.
- He's definitely built a heuristic in his mind here that's completely preventing him from solving this
- He was under the impression that he needed to get both of them there

# Waxing crescent
- He seems to be noticing that he can only move Q 2 horizontally or 2 vertically
- "How did you figure this out?"
- This level actually has slightly more mathematical beauty than I've given it credit for in the past... Though it could still be improved a bit

# Trocar
- I wonder if these initial "offsetty" puzzles are maybe not really in the spirit of the game?
- I think he thinks that both stones touching the tree is important. like he can only offset vertically if there's a vertically aligned stone against the bush. I think it's because that was the case each time he did align himself vertically, even though that's not the exact reason he was able to.
