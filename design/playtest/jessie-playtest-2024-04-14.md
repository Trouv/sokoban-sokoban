Lots of levels have been redesigned since the last playtest, so we'll see how well they work now.
Some have also been removed, so players will be getting less practice.
I'm curious to see if things are a bit inaccessible now.

# Some poor soul
- pushes block up first
- Traveling around a lot
- It's taking her some time to figure out how to offset by 1 in this redesign.
It's like she sees no purpose in going in the bottom left corner.
I hope this struggle will teach the lesson even better, once she realizes.
- I didn't realize how much this level tests offsetting.
You have to change your offset 3 times in the solution.
- She didn't get hung up in the "trap" at all here, and was able to solve it pretty quickly after realizing how to offset.

# Premature burial
This redesign is pretty major.
- *It occurs to me that we haven't demonstrated how blocks get stuck to walls.*
This level does a little bit I guess?
- The first hangup here seems to not be pushing the E to the walls, it's what to do with the Q after.
It seems hard to figure out that the 2nd move is to push Q left.
- She tries pushing Q right first.
*Maybe this level demonstrates blocks getting stuck to walls well after all?*
- Okay. I'm pretty happy with this redesign.
It seems to teach a lot of block movement lessons very efficiently.
- She's recognized how the Q is an obstacle right at the end.
- I'm not sure if I've noticed her undoing yet. Just restarting.
- She's trying the different spots where E can go.
- *I was a bit worried that the different places to put E would be a red herring for this level still.*
I don't know how to get rid of them though.
The problem with them isn't that red herrings are wrong in principle, it's that it's distracting her from the actual puzzle.
To get rid of it, I could either take the choice away or actually make one of the choices correct.

So I like this design a lot better, especially how it drives home lessons about blocks getting stuck to walls despite being useful for offsets.
It would be nice to get rid of the red herrings somehow.

# Trocar
With this redesign, this is the first exposure to salt tiles.

- Her first attempt at solving actually used pushing the blocks together in the center and then pushing the stone into the salt.
I don't think she expected the volatility of this act.
- The next thing to try seems to be pushing Q into the bush.
This is correct, I'm happy to see it happen so quickly.
- *I like this as an introduction to salt tiles actually.*
It's definitely better than what was here before.
The salt is a much more meaningful obstacle here, and all of its mechanics get introduced.
That is assuming the player tries walking into it, Jessie did.
Of course it's not possible to create a level that actually tests this mechanic since it is a fail state.
- *The divets in the wall might be slight red herrings.*
They can help you get a stone on a different horizontal offset.
I wonder if actually incorporating them into the solution would be better.
Like what if getting E to a bush that way was the actual solution.
It would certainly be harder but might be worth a try.
- She keeps trying to push the blocks together, bringing E up first or Q down first.
I wonder if this red herring is too much now that they're on the same horizontal?
- *It wouldn't be hard to move E left slightly, making it harder to push them together.*
Perhaps with this configuration it's a little too tempting.
- She got Q to the correct position but E was already in a state that made it impossible to move into position.
I think she actually needs to restart, she can't move Q back.
- She did not finish this level today.

# Follow-up
- Would you be interested in resuming later? (in which case skip the next questions)
Tomorrow

- What is your general impression of the game so far?
Challenging, but not impossible.
"Requires me to do trial and error to figure things out."
But it doesn't seem impossible, like she has options.

- These puzzles are intended to be difficult and ramp up quickly, but not unfair. Do you think that they might be too difficult?
Already answered.
