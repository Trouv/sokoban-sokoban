## 1
- "This is kind of like baba is you"
- as expected, has a hard time bringing the stone down
- didn't take too long

## 2 set the table
- moved too far into the table at first, had to move back "oh shit"
- experimenting with the table. "why did W get two ups?"
- lots of "oh"s
- moved past the A on the way up, "I can't line up with it how it is, I'll always go past it"
  - **might be a good idea to adjust the height of this level by 1**
- couldn't get lined up with the W, thought "How did I line up with the W in the first place?"
- def overthinking it after bumping into the top edge
- trying to solve for moving left.
- "I don't like that." after realizing that she got off by 1

## 3 exorcism?!
- loves the exorcism animation
- realized she needs to move S, solved it immediately

## 4 bishop 
- "jesus"
- trying to approach the S tile without going to the right first 
- can she figure out the checkerboard rule?
- "I need to change colors"
- "oh there's a bush right there"
- "Oh the grass makes the grid so I should have known if I changed colors"

## 5 full control
- "full control you say?"
- Realized pretty quickly she needs to adjust a block by one.
- alternative solution! was able to move D up one and W down
  - **Might want to consider a redesign**

## 6 Yoink
- "Can I make something else be <<?"
- Noticed the half-movement changes
- Is trying to move D. perhaps she thinks since she needs to move something left, that the rightward movement is less important?
- This is probably harder than the next level
  - **Might want to switch them after all?**
- Reset, said "So this is the point where all choiced deviate" one move early
- "hmm it doesn't have to be A that's left moving, which is kinda cool"
- so bad want to tell her she can hold z
- Still seems to be trial and erroring her way through it. That was sort of supposed to be snuffed out in the previous level
- "Oh I need more than one thing on left at the same time". I don't think this is correct but I think she's realizing the value of redundancy
- "Oh god this is very complicated now" after finding herself in the down left diagonal trap"
- realized rule 1 of sokoban. "Oh there's no way to get this back off the edge"
- A part from a couple realizations, still trial and errorring
- "I lose sight of the goal once I start editing the table"
- Wants to push a stone into another stone in the double left position.
  - Wrong lol
- "Oh interesting" Pushing left down into left left makes you go left left

## taking a break

### what do you think so far?
- "I like the idea of a game where the player modifies the control scheme"
- "It's hard for ADHD brain. struggle to plan ahead spacially"
- "It's kinda like chess, but with more order-of-operations puzzleness"

### any thoughts on levels so far?
- "It's interesting that the names give it away some times"

### Any thoughts on visuals?
- loves the death anim
- "The aesthetic is simple but cute"
- isn't a whole lot to talk about
- exorcism tiles
  - It's a little awk when there's a ton of them 
  - Maybe a line of salt? would look better in 9-slice
  - feels like the ghost posession idea is cute but doesn't solve the 9-slice
  - could just be cursed ground? or the opposite, sanctified ground?

## Back to level 6
- Realized immediately where the actual "branching off" happens
- Still mostly trial and erroring
- "I got the A where I want it but can't separate it from the S" aka on the right track
- Not thinking in terms of "utility" tables yet, that's too advanced at this point, even though it comes in handy for this puzzle
- I hope the redesign of 5 will help w/ thinking this one through
- "It has to be a double left" true
- Working through the puzzle backwards, goog
- She often gets a "setup" without the movements available to position herself for it.
- "I'm creating my own checkpoints in the puzzle. kinda cool"
- **"It might be a good idea to have an alternative undo that moves you back to the last time you pushed something"**
- She's pretty hung on a bad "checkpoint". It's probably not impossible from there, but difficult
- **I should probably make a good "diagram of abstraction" for thinking about these puzzles, and make sure that the current level order doesn't disobey it too much."**

## skipping 6 for now, going to 7 graveyard shift change
- Still don't feel great about this level
- almost figured out a good pattern for moving the A up
- is just gonna solve the puzzle w/ A lol how tf didn't I think of that

## 8 origami
- "It's like we're switching grids basically" realizes diagonalt raps
- "It's kind of fun how I eventually untuitively understand the control scheme"
- This level seems pretty effective
- She's figuring out that pushing D could get her out of the trap but has yet to identify where it needs to go
- "I guess the goal is just to get the D over to up"
- **Can we lower the height of this level?**
- "I feel like I have to move the D"
- **"I kind of wish it just had the grid"**
- Pretty happy with this level rn
- Got to the S by putting W left left, A left up and D down right
- Still in a diagonal trap here, so maybe this alternative is ok?
- specifically a down left grid, which will have to be addressed to solve the puzzle
- **It might be good to have more earlier levels that start with a utility table force the player to move more in that space, hopefully to instill the value of utility tables in general**
- Evidence for this being that still, at level 8, she is thinking about ruling out entire directions from the final table, rather than creating a table with a full range of motion
- I think this level is good but I may have failed her up to this point as a designer.
