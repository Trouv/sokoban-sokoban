# Some poor soul lost their gravestone
This is the new redesign, we'll see how it goes on a very very fresh player here
- "Two hops"
- "I'm assuming I'm pushing the stone to the other ghost"
- After figuring out his y offset, gets caught in the trap
- he says hasn't really played a sokoban game before
- Spending a good chunk of time on this one. Maybe too hard? Maybe just right and he's tired?

do you think that was too hard for a first level?
- "no, once I figured out the movement scheme"

# Narrow ritual
- Accidentally discovers all of the salt mechanics here, including volatility
- "One is probably used for clearing out the salt" (not really)

# Waxing crescent
- Learned from the last level, immediately puts one of the stones in the corner
- Uses the fence almost right, but was offset by 1 when doing so
- I think he might run into a "learning the wrong lesson" problem here since he's trying different corners

# Trocar
"These are definitely well designed because I know they're not impossible and I can think through them"
- This redesign seems pretty effective so far
- It seems pushing the Q against the bush is a pretty natural first step here
- I think once he realizes that he needs to get offset vertically it'll become clear fairly quickly
- Gets the salt with one stone but hits a softlock with the other
- ends up figuring out you can line one up by pushing two into eachother

# Vertically challenged
- *this level and the last are kinda similar. Not really a big deal*
- breezes through this one
- "that might've been an easier one"

# Felt presence
- "I just noticed that if you hit right in this corner you also go down. Oh wait no is that just the gimmick? Oh I see, I just noticed your display of controls. Nifty"
- "Got some new synapses firing"
- He seems to be a little restart-eager. I wonder if he realizes he can undo mid-level
- It seems like he has a pretty great intuition for color changing at this point, the next level will probably be pretty easy
- removes the 2nd from the top salt first. inevitable behavior
- realizes on his way over after restarting "it has to be the bottom"
- "that was a fun one"

# The bishop changes colors
- It's interesting to me how many players actually don't take the designed bias that "surely that bush over there must be important" immediately
- "chekhov's tree"
- ok no he does hit undo sometimes
- This one might just be too easy now that it's like level 7

# Jaw
- I didn't think about how using Q and E here is a hint of what's to come
- "oh, just noticed the indicators have arrows pointing in the directions"
- I guess he was referring to the movement table earlier
- First spent a lot of effort getting S to the right
- Now he's trying to skip that and move W to the left first
- "I think some of them are.. not easier, but the language of the puzzle comes out more obviously"
