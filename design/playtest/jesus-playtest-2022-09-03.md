## 0 Some poor soul lost their gravestone
- Avoids the salt trap
- needs to use the undo button, it's nice to see this happen so early on

## 1 It takes some getting used to
- Dies for the first time
- The salt in the top left seems to be providing some nice practice for what's to come
- He actually got the stone down there pretty quickly, I think the salt practice may have helped

## 2 The bishop changes color
- "I thought I was the ghost at the bottom for a second"
- Spends a good amount of time trying to push the stone down without exploring the right part of the level 
- He brushed up against the tree twice, cancelling it out
- "I'm surprised that the tree didn't do anything."
- *I think having the tree inside the salt wall would prevent this happening, but I think it might be a good thing that it happens.
Makes it slightly more challenging and makes it slightly more likely the player will understand the lesson.*
- Correctly predicts the tree's purpose when asked
- After successfully offsetting by 1, mentions that it occurred to him what he needed to do because of the checkerboard grass pattern
- Choosing to restart instead of undo when making a mistake

## 3 Set the table
- Moves S into correct position "Aw dangit"
- Discovers cancel moves for the first time
- *This level has a nice small-medium domain, good for introducing + testing the meaning of the table*
- *The first move is fairly easy to prove here, I think*
- Moves A into right-left and S into down-right, but quickly realizes that this means they can't go left
- *It seems the implicit lesson here of "cardinality" is effective*
- When moving D, he seems to be preferring alternating push directions rather than using offsets to line himself up again
- *Even with this strategy, it seems especially difficult to make that final push*

## 4 Orion's bow
- "It's funny that you can stop yourself from doing anything"
- Solves the puzzle with S in down-right surprisingly quickly
- **This puzzle could maybe be a bit harder, with a more limited solution range**

## 5 Cygnus's wing
- Tries to use D first, without cchanging the others
- makes a utility table! perhaps by accident?
- Puts D in up-up, and starts moving W, making a train utility table
- *This level definitely provides a lot of stone moving practice, more than any so far*
- Spends a lot of time trying to move the W to the left
- He is using past sokoban experience, avoiding leaning the W against the wall, even though that's more effective in this case
- Eventually commits to pushing it up against the wall "I could have made that much easier"
- *Perhaps the color-change lesson isn't general enough.
I wonder if players think that offsetting by 1 only applies a range change in 1 direction?
Instead, we need to communicate that the range change (except in the case of subgrid range) is a complete shift.
I don't know if I want to act on this observation.*
- Tries changing the table after getting W to the bottom left, interestingly
- Still mashing Z instead of holding, this is probably fine
- This decision is a mistake, but it is effectively introducing him to diagonal traps
- Still hesitant to "color change" in the end
- After solving, asks if there's multiple solutions (there are)
- "I was kind of looking for what piece I would be least likely to need at the start, but I realized I could just change the table to suit my needs"
- *this is kind of the wrong lesson, but it's still a good lesson*

## 6 Spirit gate
- *A distinction here between concepts I haven't thought about before, cardinal requirements vs movement requirements.
This the first level with a strict 'movement requirement'. You need left-left to solve this puzzle.
Previous levels had players thinking about achieving a direction as part of one of their movements, but not thinking about the entire movement.
This is an important conceptual distinction that should maybe come earlier.*
- Achieves left-left, but not utility (S is down-left)
- "It doesn't matter. I wanted to move it up so I could move it right first, but that would just make it stuck on the wall"
- "This is interesting. You have to have left-left to get here, which means you have to know what other two movements you need to succeed."
- Figures out he has hit a dead end.
- "I need two rights?" incorrect but it's cool he's thinking about it.
- *If players get lucky on the previous two levels, this level may be the first one to really force them to think about their table's utility.
Honestly, it's entirely possible they get lucky here too.
Perhaps a smaller-range puzzle between 4 and 5 would help help avoid players slipping through the cracks.*
- He has found an unexpected solution, W up-right, A right-down, S left-left. This is fine I think.
- This does create an invisible wall, but you can work around it, and he does
- *Even if players slip through some cracks, players are at least exposed to the concepts in this chapter.
These concepts are so fundamental that maybe slipping through the cracks is okay.
They will have to reckon with them soon whether or not they were effectively introduced here.
And when that time comes, they'll at least have ths little bit of exposure to help them out.
Maybe I'm just making excuses though.*

## 7 Origami boat
- "Whoa"
- The first goal he sets out for is setting right-right, which is wrong, but expected.
- Achieves the correct table, but does he realize it's the correct table? Not yet.
- *I think players at this point are getting a little jaded about trying out the initial table.
In the case of this level, trying out the initial table is important to understanding the obstacle.
Maybe making the goal stone more accessable from the start would make players more likely to give it a shot?*
- Starts trying to push D down instead of changing the table, a good idea that doesn't work.
- Discovers that you can hold undo!!
- "That's pretty fun actually"
- Gets the correct table again, this time solves it.
- "I think I'm overthinking this"

## 8 Wallflower
- Gets A as far as he can with S down-down
- **I really need to make more levels where the players need to change the table multiple times.
It feels like players expect this sort of challenge, and it could lead to very interesting puzzles.**
- *Interestingly, Jesus seems to be solving puzzles this way anyway.
It's not efficient but I think it's helping him chunk the challenge up into individual pieces.
On top of that, the lessons of each level seem to be getting across, even with this "chunking".
I'm pretty happy with this.*
- "Maybe? might as well try"
- He's having a particularly difficult time finding the right table that will get him around the final "wall" challenge in the top right corner.
- He's still giving diagonal traps more time than they're worth.
- *I'm actually kind of relieved by this.
It justifies Origami fortune teller's inclusion a little more.*
- He's been struggling for a bit. I asked him what he's thinking: "My first thought is trying to get W up-right"
- He's able to move the A with a top-right diagonal trap instead of a utility table.
- He's struggling to make the final push to solve the puzzle this way.
- If he can't do it, I'll need to check if it's possible or not, I may have accidentally outruled this particular diagonal trap.
However, it's probably possible?
- Yeah it should be possible. That's probably fine
- He solves it this way

## Final thoughts of the day
What did you think so far?
"Looks nice, funny concept, definitely plays with what you're used to"

Any particular level you enjoyed?
He enjoyed spirit gate, because of the left-left restriction.

Any huge difficulty spikes?
He breezed through it pretty quickly, so probably not.
Nope.
