### 1
- "Annoying in a fun way"
- amused by undo button
- took a really long time to move the block down

### 2
- excited to learn that you can change the table

### 3
- trying to change the table instead of just moving the A block
- figured it out in a good amount of time

### 4
- Thinks "The bishop changes colors" is a good name
- Tries for a while to ignore the right half of the level
- "That's so clever"
- Thought he was gonna be able to push the bush?

### 5 -> 6
- "I'm not paying attention to the things I should be"
- **Non-table inputs still add to history**
- **You should be able to hold down undo**
- This level may be a bit too much of a difficulty spike
- He finds the train amusing
- "Why didn't I think about it like that"
  - The left line is lined up w/ the exit

### 6 -> 7

### 7 -> 8

### 8 -> 9
- "This is annoying"
- I think this level, like many others, may be a little too much brute force
- Although it seems like the easiest way to solve it is by doing this cool push-against bush after getting "set free", which ties it together a bit.
- He's figured out the way to think about these levels at this point.
  - He's looking for sub goals.
  - He's thinking about RANKS and FILES
- More evidence that the order of the legend needs to be prescriptive
- "Might be nice to be able to undo restarting"
- It's hard.
- He chose to skip after an hour
- got it on broken screen recording with intended solution

### 9 -> 10
- Immediately says "I like this level"
- By now he's figured out offsetting by one
- "This sucks"
- Moved W to << and laughed when he realized he can't go up
- "I really like the two puzzles that I'm stuck on"
- His favorite so far.
  - "It's obvious what you need to do, so I'm proud that I know how to approach it, but it's still super hard"
### second session of this level
- He explains a sub-goal of the W and S locations correctly, But places D in the top right which isn't necessary
- Getting undo and restart mixed in his brain
  - Another reason to be able to undo restarts
- "There's a lot of thinking in terms of 'which tomb do I need to place first?'"
  - "But I feel like I'm not good enough at chess to put those thoughts into practice"
- Incidentally, he hasn't found that moving S up first is an alternative opening, which is the best solution
  - Actually there is an alternative I just found moving W first
  - This misdirection is somewhat intentional, so I'm glad it's working
- He's skipping for now

### 10 -> 11
- Noticed there's two pretty immediately
- Struggling with initial moves
- Puts the S on the board bc of the title of the level
- Moves the W down to the bottom right goal, a solution I don't think I saw but it's fine
- Struggling a bit to get offset by one, or maybe realizing that that's what he needs to do
  - Maybe the lesson in bishop isn't clear enough?
  - Or maybe it's fine and he's just limited by how broken up his playtime is?
  - Yeah, he's struggling to see simpler ways of offsetting, going to the top of the screen even though the right is fine.
- "That's the first one that I've been able to plan the end in advance"
  - "Probably some earlier levels I could've done that but was busy thinking about other skills"
- He solved this one pretty quickly. Good break from the previous level

### 11 -> 12

### 12 -> 13
