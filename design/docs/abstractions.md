# Conceptual Analysis
I think it may be useful to frame this game's level design in terms of its concepts.
Then, we can analyze levels in terms of what concepts they "reinforce", and what concepts they "introduce".

Introducing a concept should be explicitly designed.
While levels that are the first to feature a concept may technically be introducing it, they should be considered reinforcments unless a higher standard of introduction is met.

Concepts that are reinforced without introduction may warrant some adjustments, or the creation of a new level.
Other concepts may not need to be teached.
They might just not be interesting enough, or maybe they can't be tested in any way.
One example that comes to mind is "holding undo".
It'd still be nice to list these.


## Levels of abstraction
We will organize concepts into their levels of abstraction.
These are generally in order of difficulty.
Some advanced concepts within lower categories may be more advanced than novice concepts in higher categories.
